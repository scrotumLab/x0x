Please read this before starting to populate your boards!

WARNING / VERY IMPORTANT before placing headers on the HEART PCB: 
1- Check first what headers are needed on the Pacemaker PCB and also check the next warning before placing headers on the HEART PCB, because not all headers are needed on the HEART PCB and also the orientation is very important. 

2- On the HEART PCB you will see silkscreen markings where to place the headers. But you will need to place them on the opposite side of the board than where they are supposed to be, so the HEART PCB can fit the Pacemaker board. Also, placed this way, all components on the HEART PCB will be accessible and not facing the panel anymore.
See photos to be 100% sure!

3- VR11 is a 9mm trimmer pot like seen here:

So it can fit my panel layout. I chosed a long one, but itâ€™s up to you to prefer a short one.

4- J1 and J8 headers on Pacemaker board are placed side-by-side

5A- If you have a Pacemaker rev 2.0 board
On HEART PCB connect via wire:
J9/pin3 to J1/pin9
J1/pin3 to J8/pin2 (GND)
J1/pin1 to J8/pin3

5B- If you have a Pacemaker rev 1.0 board
R51 on Pacemaker board is not 100k, cause no resistor should be soldered here, instead both pads need to be connected together.
On HEART PCB connect via wire:
J9/pin3 to 100k resistor to J1/pin9
J1/pin3 to J8/pin2 (GND)
J1/pin1 to J8/pin3
