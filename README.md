The Scrotum Lab / Késako Pacemaker board Rev 2.0 is an adaptation made to run a x0x heart on a 4U Serge panel using bananas and powered by -12V/0V/+12V.
No wiring for panel components required.

The x0x heart board I used was bought at www.synthcube.com.
The reference is PRTOLX0XHEART00

The Scrotum Lab / Késako schematics for the Pacemaker board Rev 2.0 are based on the original x0x-heart pacemaker_smt made by guest openmusiclabs 7.9.16.

Scrotum Lab / Késako Rev 2.0 / December 2021 mods & adds:
- Replacing 3.5mm jacks (incl. normalization) by bananas
- Adding also a header for direct connections via ribbon cable to bananas
- Modifying some original headers to avoid the need of any wiring to connect to the Heart PCB.
- R46, R47, R48, R49 are added to shut off the PWM
- Adding a VCA input
